        <h2>SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
 <p><br><h4>Definition:</h4>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common form of skin cancer that primarily affects the squamous cells in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. It tends to develop in areas of the skin that have been exposed to the sun or other sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. 

    <br><h4>Cause:</h4>UV Radiation Exposure: Prolonged and repeated exposure to UV radiation from the sun or artificial sources (tanning beds) is a primary risk factor for SCC.

    Fair Skin: Individuals with fair skin, light hair, and light-colored eyes are at a higher risk.
    
    Advanced Age: SCC is more common in older adults.
    
    Previous Skin Cancer: A history of other skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, can increase the risk.
    
    Weakened Immune System: A weakened immune system due to medical conditions or medications can raise the risk.
    
    <h4><br>Common Symptoms of Dermatofibroma:</h4>

    Skin Lesions: SCC typically appears as a red, scaly, firm, and raised bump or nodule on the skin. It may have a crust or ulceration on the surface.

    Rapid Growth: SCC lesions can grow relatively quickly and may become larger over a few weeks to months.
    
    Pain or Itching: Some SCCs can be painful or cause persistent itching.
    
    Bleeding or Oozing: SCC lesions may bleed or ooze fluid, especially if they are irritated or injured.
    
    Changes in Existing Lesions: SCC can also develop within existing skin conditions, scars, or chronic wounds. Any changes in these areas, such as increased redness, scaling, or ulceration, should be evaluated.
    
    Location: SCC most commonly occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, lips, chest, backs of hands, arms, and legs.
    
    Lymph Node Enlargement: If SCC has spread beyond the skin, it can lead to the enlargement of nearby lymph nodes.
