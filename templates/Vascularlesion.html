        <h2>ASCULAR LESION</h2>
    </header>
    <main>
 <p><br><h4>Definition:</h4>Vascular lesions are abnormalities or malformations of blood vessels that can occur anywhere in the body, including the skin and internal organs. They can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life (acquired). Vascular lesions can vary in size, appearance, and severity.

    <br><h4>Cause:</h4>Congenital Factors: Some vascular lesions are present at birth or develop shortly afterward due to genetic or developmental factors.

    Genetic Mutations: Certain genetic mutations may predispose individuals to develop specific vascular lesions.
    
    Hormonal Changes: Hormonal fluctuations, such as those during pregnancy, can influence the development of some vascular lesions.
    
    Sun Exposure: Prolonged exposure to sunlight can contribute to the development of certain vascular lesions.
    
    Family History: A family history of vascular lesions can increase the risk of developing similar conditions.
    
    Environmental Factors: Other environmental factors, trauma, or injuries can also play a role in the development of vascular lesions.
    
    <h4><br>Common Symptoms of Dermatofibroma:</h4>

    Redness or Discoloration: Vascular lesions often cause red or purplish discoloration of the skin or mucous membranes.

Pain or Discomfort: Some vascular lesions, particularly AVMs, may cause pain, throbbing, or a sensation of fullness in the affected area.

Swelling: Vascular lesions can lead to swelling, especially if they involve the limbs or other body parts.

Bleeding or Bruising: Fragile blood vessels within certain vascular lesions may rupture, leading to bleeding or bruising.

Ulceration: In severe cases, vascular lesions can cause skin ulcers or sores.

Cosmetic Concerns: Many vascular lesions, such as spider veins or port-wine stains, are primarily of cosmetic concern and do not cause significant discomfort or health issues
